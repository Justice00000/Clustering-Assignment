# Clustering Assignment

This project is a simple exploration of clustering on sound features using K-Means and DBSCAN.

I:
- Used the Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters
- Applied both K-Means and DBSCAN for unsupervised learning
- Evaluated clusters using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index
- Visualized the results with t-SNE for better interpretation

**Quick Insight:**  
K-Means gave some structure (Silhouette ~0.17), while DBSCAN didnâ€™t find meaningful clusters with default settings.
